"""What is actually on disk, for the Library and Stats screens.

Both are read-only views over a walk of the library tree. No cache: at a
real library size - 5,794 tracks, 4,295 sidecars - the walk plus a read
of every .lrc measures 0.08s warm and under half a second cold, which is
not worth a second copy of the truth that can go stale.

Embedded tags are the exception and are deliberately not read here. A
mutagen open per file is the one part that is not free, and nothing on
these screens needs it: album and artist come from the path Beetdrop
itself filed the track into, and the rest is stat() and sidecar text.
