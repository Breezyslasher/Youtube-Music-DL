"""Correct a track that was matched to the wrong recording.

Matching is duration-first text similarity with no acoustic
fingerprinting, so a cover, a re-upload or a same-length different song
can get through - and anything it could not verify at all is filed under
_review/ with tags taken from YouTube. Both leave a file on disk whose
tags are wrong and which nothing else will ever revisit.

This lets a person say what the track actually is. It searches
MusicBrainz, describes the candidates so they can be told apart, and on
a choice re-tags the file and moves it to where those tags say it
belongs - out of _review/ and into the library proper, in the usual
case.

Nothing here guesses. Matching already had its turn; a person picking is
the whole point, so the candidates are shown as MusicBrainz returned
them rather than filtered by the checks that got it wrong.
