# kind is "track" or "album". For album jobs the video_id column carries
# the YouTube Music album browseId; detail carries per-track progress
# text ("track 3/12: Title") and, when some tracks fail, the delivered
# count.

# inbox_state (column name kept for database compatibility) records the
# filing outcome: "" (not finished), "filed" (verified and in the
# library), "unverified" (no MusicBrainz match; filed under _review).

# Settings the API may read and write. yt-dlp version is reported
# read-only by the settings endpoint and lives nowhere.
