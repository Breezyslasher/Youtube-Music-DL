"""Merging the settings saved through the UI onto the environment config.

This lives apart from app.py because the CLI needs it too. It used to be
a closure inside create_app, which meant `python -m beetdrop` saw only
environment variables: the Apple and Musixmatch tokens, the provider
choice and the word-by-word setting are all stored in SQLite by the
Settings page, so every CLI lyrics command ran as though none of them
were configured. scan-lyrics --upgrade in particular became a silent
no-op - it asks Apple and nothing else, and without a token it never
asked anything.
