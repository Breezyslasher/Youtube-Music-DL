"""Title cleaning. Pure functions.

Strip obvious noise from a YouTube title — Official Video, Official Audio,
Lyrics, Visualizer, HQ, and bare bracketed years — but never qualifiers
that change what the recording is: Live, Acoustic, Remix, Extended, Radio
Edit must survive to the card, because seeing them is how the user avoids
grabbing the wrong thing.

The raw title is kept in the record for debugging; only display and seed
tags use the cleaned one.
