# Beetdrop

A mobile-first, self-hosted web app: search YouTube Music for a song or
album, download the audio, match it against MusicBrainz, and file it -
fully tagged, with cover art - straight into your music library.
Standalone: no beets, no external tagger, one container.

## What a grab does

1. Downloads bestaudio (opus by default; m4a and mp3 offered; the
   stream is copied without re-encoding when the source codec already
   matches). No FLAC or WAV: the source tops out around 160 kbps Opus /
   256 kbps AAC, and a lossless container would only misreport quality.
2. Matches against MusicBrainz. Singles use duration-first recording
   scoring - more than 8 seconds off is rejected outright, live/remix
   qualifiers must agree on both sides, artist and title compare after
   normalisation - plus release selection that prefers the earliest
   official studio release over compilations and live albums. Albums
   are matched as one release (title/artist/track-count scoring), then
   the tracklists are aligned by album order and verified by durations.
3. Writes full Picard-compatible tags: artist credits with joinphrases,
   album, date, track and disc numbers with totals, and MusicBrainz
   recording/release/release-group/artist IDs in the locations Picard
   uses - so Plex, Navidrome, and Picard all agree with the files.
4. Embeds cover art from the Cover Art Archive (release, then release
   group, then the YouTube thumbnail as last resort) and writes
   cover.jpg into the album folder.
5. Files atomically into the library as
   {albumartist}/{album} ({year})/{disc-}NN - {title}.{ext}, never
   overwriting - collisions get a " (2)" suffix.
6. Fetches synced (timed) lyrics and writes a .lrc sidecar next to the
   track - the format Plex, Navidrome, and most players read for synced
   lyrics. Two sources: LRCLIB and Musixmatch. Settings picks the primary
   provider (the other is the fallback); whichever returns timed lyrics
   first wins. Timed only: results with only plain text are skipped.
   Musixmatch needs a session token - fetch the latest one with a button
   in Settings (same as updating yt-dlp), or paste your own. Best effort,
   and toggleable in Settings (or BEETDROP_LYRICS). A "Fetch lyrics for
   existing library" button (CLI: `scan-lyrics`) backfills sidecars for
   tracks already in the library that have none yet, using the same
   source - it runs as a cancellable job in the queue. Artist and title
   come from the tags, falling back to the folder/file names
   ({Artist}/{Album}/{NN} - {Title} or "Artist - Title"); duration always
   comes from the decoded audio, so even untagged files can be matched.
   Placeholder lyrics are rejected: an LRC whose lines are perfectly
   evenly spaced is generated junk, never a real transcription, so it is
   never written. "Delete bad lyrics and re-fetch" (CLI: `scan-lyrics
   --refresh`) removes existing placeholder sidecars - whatever wrote
   them - and looks those tracks up again. The check is timing-only, so
   real lyrics in any language, romaji included, are never deleted.

Grabs that cannot be verified against MusicBrainz are filed under
_review/ with YouTube-derived tags and an unverified marker, so the
clean library never gets polluted silently. The queue shows which
outcome each grab had.

MusicBrainz calls are rate limited to one per second process-wide and
cached in SQLite for 30 days. Honest caveat: there is no acoustic
fingerprinting, so a wrong-video grab (a cover, a re-upload) can only
be caught by duration and text similarity - watch the duration on the
cards and the _review folder.

## Albums

Search toggles between songs and albums (UI, `--albums` on the CLI,
`type=albums` on the API). Individual track failures do not abort an
album: the rest is filed and the job records which tracks failed and
why (including tracks YouTube Music serves without a videoId). Track
numbering preserves gaps. An album that finished with gaps shows a
"Retry failed tracks" button that re-downloads only the failures and
slots them into the album folder.

## Music videos

A third search mode, Videos (UI tab, `--videos` on the CLI, `type=videos`
on the API), grabs music videos instead of audio. Each is downloaded as an
mp4 (video+audio merged, capped at 1080p by default - configurable up to
4K or uncapped), best-effort matched against MusicBrainz for a clean
artist/title/album, and filed Kodi-style:

```
{video library}/{Artist}/{Artist} - {Title}.mp4
                        /{Artist} - {Title}.nfo        <- Kodi <musicvideo>
                        /{Artist} - {Title}-poster.jpg
```

The `.nfo` and poster are the exact names Kodi's Music Videos scraper
reads, so a scan needs no network lookup. Unlike an audio grab, a video
that does not match MusicBrainz is still filed (the video is the point);
the match only enriches its metadata.

Videos are filed to a **separate** library from your audio, because Kodi
treats Music and Music Videos as two library types with their own sources
and scrapers - mixing them in one folder is discouraged. By default the
video library is a `Music Videos` subfolder of `/music`, so no extra mount
is needed; set `VIDEO_PATH` (or the Settings field) to put it on its own
disk. Max quality is set with `BEETDROP_VIDEO_MAX_HEIGHT` or in Settings.

## Web UI and API

`python -m beetdrop serve` (port 8090) serves a single-page PWA:
search cards with prominent durations, a live queue (SSE) with cancel,
retry, per-job logs, and progress, and a settings panel. Duplicate
grabs are detected and confirmed before re-downloading. Passwords are
stored hashed, sessions ride an HttpOnly cookie, failed logins are
throttled (Cloudflare-tunnel aware), and yt-dlp can be updated live
from Settings with no restart.

```
GET  /api/search?q=&type=songs|albums|videos
POST /api/grab                    {"video_id", "kind", "format", "force"}
GET  /api/jobs                    POST /api/jobs/{id}/retry|cancel
GET/PUT /api/settings             GET /api/health   GET /events (SSE)
POST /api/login                   POST /api/ytdlp/update
POST /api/lyrics/musixmatch-token POST /api/lyrics/scan
```

## Running it

```
docker compose up -d
```

See docker-compose.yml: mount /config (state) and /music (your
library), set PUID/PGID to the library owner. Environment variables:
`MUSIC_PATH`, `BEETDROP_CONFIG`, `BEETDROP_FORMAT`, `BEETDROP_BITRATE`,
`BEETDROP_PASSWORD`, `BEETDROP_COOKIES`, `BEETDROP_CONCURRENCY` (1-4),
`BEETDROP_LYRICS`, `BEETDROP_LYRICS_PROVIDER` (lrclib|musixmatch),
`BEETDROP_MXM_TOKEN` (Musixmatch token), `VIDEO_PATH` (music-video
library; defaults to a subfolder of /music), `BEETDROP_VIDEO_MAX_HEIGHT`
(video quality cap in px, default 1080, 0 = uncapped), `BEETDROP_TRACK_DELAY`,
`BEETDROP_MIN_FREE_MB`, `BEETDROP_KEEP_JOBS`, `BEETDROP_KEEP_DAYS`,
`BEETDROP_SCRATCH`. Legacy `TRACKPULL_*` names are still honored.

CLI:

```
python -m beetdrop search "artist song" [--albums | --videos]
python -m beetdrop grab <video_id> [--album | --video] [--format opus|m4a|mp3] [--library PATH]
python -m beetdrop scan-lyrics [--refresh]     # backfill .lrc (--refresh purges junk first)
python -m beetdrop serve [--host 0.0.0.0] [--port 8090]
```

History: this project previously fed a beets/beets-flask inbox
("Trackpull", then Beetdrop inbox mode). That pipeline was removed in
0.11.0 - the last inbox-capable image is 0.10.x.

## Tests

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/
```
